# Translating CheatDevice Remastered
_Translation add-on made and guide written by [@danssmnt](https://github.com/danssmnt)_.

## How can I translate CDR to my native language?

Translating CDR is actually pretty simple, but, read everything in this README before starting!

 1. Clone ``sample.ini`` and rename it to: ``{Language 2 Letter Code}_{Country Code}.ini`` (e.g.: ``pt_PT.ini``)

 > [!NOTE]
 > If you don't know the codes, check them here:
 >  - [Countries' Language Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) (use Set 1)
 >  - [Countries' Country Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements)

 2. Fill out the ``INFO`` section.

| Key                       | Meaning                                                                       |
|:-------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``Translate Version``     | Cheat Device Remastered version that you're translating (latest one normally) |
| ``Translate Author``      | Name of the people that contributed to the translation                        |
| ``Translate Language``    | Name of the language with format: ``Language (Country)``                      |

 3. Start translating! Fill every line with an english string and ``=`` with the translated string after.

> [!WARNING]
>  - You can only use [ASCII printable characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_character_table), if you try to use accented or other types of characters, they won't show in CDR.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't want / need to translate a string, just leave everything after the ``=`` blank (it will default to english in CDR).
> If you don't wanna delete an ``.ini`` file but don't want it to show on CDR, simply add "_ignore.ini" to its filename.
